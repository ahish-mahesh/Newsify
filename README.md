# NEWSIFY

Why have multiple apps for each new source when you can have a single app which combines all the sources in one place. 
Newsify is a news tracker which brings in multiple news feeds all together in a single place. 
The main aim of this project is to provide the user with a personalised news feed which is content specific rather than source specific.
